## Discord chat rules

1. Must be located in or near to Vancouver, British Columbia.
2. No racist/sexist/derogatory/overly NSFW/political/religious content. No gore, and no pics of bike accidents please. Have some common sense. We encourage healthy fucking amounts of swearing. Just don't be a dick!
3. Advertising other discords, or anything that could be seen as annoying to other users is prohibited. This includes self-advertisement and posting links that may be harmful.
4. We have zero tolerance for inappropriate DM'ing of our members, and this includes no inappopriate messages in chat (weeb/fetish/creepy/porn videos, pictures etc.).

If you need to report someone from the chat, or if someone is harassing or spamming you through DMs, please message one of the Discord moderators directly.

## Group riding etiquette

Always arrive prepared and arrive on time with a full tank of gas.

Ride in formation - Riding must be done in staggered formation on straight sections of the road. If the leader changes position, then one by one the group will change to their new position. In a curvy section of road, each member should ride in a single-file line approximately two seconds apart. The spacing and lane position can be adjusted accordingly for safety, but this should give each member time to adjust to any other traffic and changing conditions. Once the road straightens again, then it's back to staggered formation.

Passing - Passing is never to be done in the same lane as another rider, unless they are explicitly waving you past. Avoid side-by-side formations, as they reduce the space cushion. If you suddenly needed to swerve to avoid a hazard, you would not have room to do so. The exception to this is pulling up to a stop and you will pull up side-by-side and remove the gap in front of you.

Periodically check the riders following using your mirrors - If you see a rider falling behind, slow down so they may catch up. If all the riders in the group do this, the group should be able to maintain a fairly steady speed without pressure to ride too fast to catch up.

Stop signs/lights - The group should move as one unit. The leader should wait until the whole group is behind them, and only pull out when there's a decent gap to allow the whole group to get through. If there's no opportunity for that, then the leader should get through and pull over at the first opportunity and wait for the whole group to catch up. Only once the whole group is together again should riding commence.

Ride your own ride and at your own pace - We don't promote reckless riding in this group, but if at any time a ride is too fast for you, just let us know and we can slow things down.

Play motorcycle photo tag across Vancouver, share pics of your motorbikes and your pets, talk about and plan Vancouver motorbike track days or dual sport rides, find people to game online with, talk about your favourite sports teams, get notified of social meetups and so much more. We have something for everyone and are always open to new suggestions to be more inclusive and improve the chat group for all riders to enjoy.
