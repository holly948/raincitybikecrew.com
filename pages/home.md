<big>Hey fellow bike lover! Glad to see you made it. Are you located in Vancouver, Canada? Come join our Vancouver motorcycle chat group on Discord!</big>

If you live in or near Vancouver, British Columbia, and you love motorcycles and meeting new people, then we'd love to have you join our Vancouver motorcycle social group. Our Vancouver motorbike meetup group enjoys weekly to biweekly social events (ice cream meetups, grabbing a coffee, lacrosse games, trying out new bars and restaurants, games nights, going to concerts etc.), and of course long and short group rides!

The Raincity Bike Crew welcomes Vancouver riders and enthusiasts of all ages, motorbike types and backgrounds. It doesn't matter what motorcycle you ride (yes, even scooters!), just so long as you love meeting other riders and being part of a great riding community. We do not encourage illegal riding or anything to endanger others on group rides. Our Vancouver motorcycle chat group rides tend to be chill, at speed limits and a solid focus on snaccs and drinks along the way!

*If you are unvaccinated, you are not welcome on group rides or any other social meetups. This is for the safety of our group members, their close friends and family, and anyone else they might come in contact with.*

## Discord chat rules

1. Must be located in or near to Vancouver, British Columbia.
2. No racist/sexist/derogatory/overly NSFW/political/religious content. No gore, and no pics of bike accidents please. Have some common sense. We encourage healthy fucking amounts of swearing. Just don't be a dick!
3. Advertising other discords, or anything that could be seen as annoying to other users is prohibited. This includes self-advertisement and posting links that may be harmful.
4. We have zero tolerance for inappropriate DM'ing of our members, and this includes inappopriate messages in chat (weeb/fetish/creepy/porn videos, pictures etc.).
