<big>Hey there! Are you located in Vancouver, BC? Come join our Vancouver motorcycle group chat on Discord!</big>

If you live in or near Vancouver and you have a love for motorcycles and making new friends, then we'd love to have you join our Vancouver motorcycle group. Our Vancouver motorcycle meetup group enjoys weekly to biweekly social events (ice cream meetups, grabbing a coffee, lacrosse games, trying out new bars and restaurants, games nights, going to concerts etc.), and of course, motorcycle group rides!

We are a geeky, chill, welcoming, and fun group of people of all ages, ranging from teens to retired folk.

The Raincity Bike Crew welcomes Vancouver motorcycle riders and enthusiasts of all ages, motorbike types and backgrounds. It doesn't matter what motorcycle you ride (yes, even scooters!), just so long as you love meeting other riders and being part of a great riding community. Most of our group rides tend to be chill and at speed limits, with snacks and drinks along the way!

We do not encourage illegal riding or anything to endanger others on group rides.

**NOTE:** Our motorcycle group is for active members only, either active on chat, or actively coming to meetups (or both!). Lurkers will be removed from the group if they have not been active after a month or two.
