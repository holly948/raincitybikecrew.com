<big>Hey fellow bike lover! Glad to see you made it. Are you located in Vancouver, Canada?</big>

If you live in or near Vancouver, British Columbia, and love motorcycles and meeting new people, then we'd love to have you join!

We have a pretty great group because we all share the same love of motorcycles, enjoy meeting new people and exploring this incredible city and the surrounds.

The Raincity Bike Crew welcomes Vancouver riders and enthusiasts of all ages, all bike types, all riding styles, all genders, all races, and from all backgrounds. It doesn't matter what motorbike you ride (yes, even scooters!), just so long as you love meeting other riders and being part of a great riding community.
