<big>Hey fellow bike lover! Glad to see you made it. Are you located in Vancouver, Canada?</big>

If you live in or near Vancouver, British Columbia, and you love motorcycles and meeting new people, then we'd love to have you join our social group.

The Raincity Bike Crew welcomes Vancouver riders and enthusiasts of all ages, bike types and backgrounds. It doesn't matter what motorbike you ride (yes, even scooters!), just so long as you love meeting other riders and being part of a great riding community. We do not encourage illegal riding or anything to endanger others on group rides. Our group rides tend to be chill, at speed limits and a solid focus on snaccs and drinks along the way!

*If you are unvaccinated, you are not welcome on group rides or any other social meetups. This is for the safety of our group members, their close friends and family, and anyone else they might come in contact with.*

2. No racist/sexist/derogatory/overly NSFW/political/religious content. No gore, and no pics of bike accidents please. Have some common sense. We encourage healthy fucking amounts of swearing. Just don't be a dick!
3. Advertising other discords, or anything that could be seen as annoying to other users is prohibited. This includes self-advertisement and posting links that may be harmful.
