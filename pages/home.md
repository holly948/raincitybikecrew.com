<big>Hello motorcycle enthusiast! Are you located in Vancouver, Canada? Come join our Vancouver motorcycle chat group on Discord!</big>

If you live in or near Vancouver, British Columbia, and you love motorcycles and meeting new people, then we'd love to have you join our Vancouver motorcycle social group. Our Vancouver motorbike meetup group enjoys weekly to biweekly social events (ice cream meetups, grabbing a coffee, lacrosse games, trying out new bars and restaurants, games nights, going to concerts etc.), and of course, motorcycle group rides!

The Raincity Bike Crew welcomes Vancouver riders and enthusiasts of all ages, motorbike types and backgrounds. It doesn't matter what motorcycle you ride (yes, even scooters!), just so long as you love meeting other riders and being part of a great riding community. Our Vancouver motorbike chat group rides tend to be chill and at speed limits, with snaccs and drinks along the way! We do not encourage illegal riding or anything to endanger others on group rides.

**NOTE:** Our motorcycle group is for active members only, either active on chat, or actively coming to meetups (or both!). Lurkers will be removed from the group if they have not been active after a month or two.

**WHAT IS DISCORD?** Discord is similar to Slack or WhatsApp. It's a chatroom that is accessed through an app or through your web browser, and there's multiple "rooms" or "channels" for various interests to talk about. For example, we have a channel for pet pics, another for discussing motorcycle track days, a channel for gaming and so many more. It's a place to easily chat on various topics, and having multiple channels makes it easier to stay on topic and not interrupt an ongoing conversation by posting in the correct channel. It's the new forum for today's tech savvy riders.

*If you are unvaccinated, you are not welcome on group rides or any other social meetups. We do not allow debates on the current pandemic or laws/politics surrounding it. If you're an anti-vaxxer or a Tr#mp lover, this Discord is not for you.*
