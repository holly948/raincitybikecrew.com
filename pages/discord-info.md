## How to mute channels/rooms

**On desktop app:** right-click the channel's name and select "Mute channel." You can then pick how long you'd like to mute the channel for, be it 15 minutes, an hour, or until indefinitely.

**On mobile app:** tap the channel's name at the top of the screen, and then the bell icon in the menu that appears. You'll then be able to pick how long you'd like to mute the channel for, or change your settings to only be notified about @mentions (when someone pings you).
