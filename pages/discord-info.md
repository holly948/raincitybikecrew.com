# How to navigate Discord

## What is Discord?

Discord is similar to Slack or WhatsApp. It's a chatroom that is accessed through an app or through your web browser, and there's multiple "rooms" or "channels" for various interests to talk about. For example, we have a channel for pet pics, another for discussing motorcycle track days, a channel for gaming, one for your motorcycle garage projects, and so many more. It's a place to easily chat on various topics, and having multiple channels makes it easier to stay on topic and not interrupt an ongoing conversation by posting in the correct channel. It's the new forum for today's tech savvy riders.

## How to mute channels/rooms

**On desktop:** right-click the channel name and select "Mute channel." You'll then be able to pick how long you'd like to mute the channel for, or change your settings to only be notified about @mentions (when someone pings you).

**On mobile:** tap the channel name at the top of the screen, and then the bell icon in the menu that appears. You'll then be able to pick how long you'd like to mute the channel for, or change your settings to only be notified about @mentions (when someone pings you).
